        <a href="Jack's_Grad_School_Paper.pdf">Music Information Retrieval in Bandcamp</a>    
        </dt>
        <dd>A graduate paper for the University of Missouri. The paper is an APA-style, user experience (UX) literature review. At the time, I was enrolled as a library and information science student. The paper received full marks from three peer reviewers and the professor.

        <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/soogr">HIM Configuration Help</a></dt>
        <dd>A brief instruction manual that I wrote for Oracle Health. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. Subject-matter expertise was provided by the Cerner HIM product and engineering teams. Editorial guidance was prodived by my documentation architect. It is hosted on the Cerner Confluence instance, <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://differentvisions.org/homage-to-medieval-langres/">Saint Didier's Flowering Verge...</a></dt>
        <dd>A peer-reviewed article I wrote in collaboration with my research mentor. The article was published in the art history journal, <a href="https://differentvisions.org/">Different Visions</a>, which is supported by St. Olaf College and Oklahoma State University.

        <dt><a href="https://daedalus.umkc.edu/CODICES/royer-walton.html">A Quantitative Analysis of the Royer Didier</a></dt>
        <dd>A blog post I wrote for UM Kansas City while I was working as an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://daedalus.umkc.edu/CODICES/projects.html">codices digital humanities lab</a>. I describe my experiments with natural language processing. I also discuss how I adapted as a researcher during the pandemic.</dd>

        <dt><a href="Grant_Proposal.pdf">Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunity Grant Proposal</a></dt>
        <dd>A grant proposal I wrote while employed as a an undergraduate researcher at codices. The travel grant, which was worth $1250, was not funded due to the 2020 lockdown. However, the university did award me a <a href="Certificate_of_Achievement.pdf">certificate of achievement</a> for the quality of the document.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://variantlit.com/test-signal/"> Test Signal</a></dt>
        <dd>A bit of experimental poetry I wrote. It was published in the first issue of <a href="https://variantlit.com/">Variant Literature</a>. Read at your own risk.</dd>
