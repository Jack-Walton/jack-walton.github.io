        <a href="Jack's_Grad_School_Paper.pdf">Music Information Retrieval in Bandcamp</a>    
        </dt>
        <dd>A graduate paper for the University of Missouri. The paper is an APA-style, UX literature review. At the time, I was enrolled as a library and information science student. The paper received full marks from three peer reviewers and the professor. In this paper, I analyze the Bandcamp information system against peer-reviewed literature to derive auspicious web design ideas.</dd>

        <dt><a href="Grant_Proposal_v2.pdf">Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunity Grant Proposal</a></dt>
        <dd>A grant proposal I wrote while an undergraduate researcher. The travel grant, which was worth $1250, was not funded due to the 2020 lockdown. However, the university did award me a <a href="Certificate_of_Achievement.pdf">certificate of achievement</a> for the quality of the document.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/soogr">HIM Configuration Help</a></dt>
        <dd>A brief instruction manual that I wrote for Oracle Health. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. Subject-matter expertise was provided by the Cerner HIM product and engineering teams. Editorial guidance was prodived by my documentation architect. It is hosted on the Cerner Confluence instance, <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/4gQtAQ">Health Information Management Help Pages</a></dt>
        <dd>A set of instruction manuals that I edit for Oracle Health. This technology is used to encode medical encounters to transmit to payers for verification.</dd>

        <dd>A brief instruction manual that I wrote for the Department of Defense. This technology helps veteran's hospitals configure healthcare benfits for patients.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/9UMZUQ">Value-Based Reimbursement Help</a></dt>
        <dd>A brief instruction manual that I edited for an experimental healthcare financial schema. The idea was that doctors would be paid based on results rather than procedures.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/95j0gg">Acute Case Management Help</a></dt>
        <dd>Another instruction manual that I edit for Oracle Health. This software is used to help document healthcare experiences, mostly for financial purposes.</dd>

I describe my experiments with natural language processing. I also discuss how I adapted as a researcher during the pandemic.</dd>
