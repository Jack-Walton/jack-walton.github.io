    </dt>
    <dd>A graduate paper for the University of Missouri. The paper is an APA-style, user experience (UX) literature review. At the time, I was enrolled as a library and information science student. The paper received full marks from three peer reviewers and the professor. In this paper, I analyze the Bandcamp information system against peer-reviewed literature to derive auspicious web design ideas.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/soogr">HIM Configuration Help</a></dt>
    <dd>A brief instruction manual that I wrote for Oracle Health. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. Subject-matter expertise was provided by the Cerner HIM product and engineering teams. Editorial guidance was prodived by my documentation architect. It is hosted on the Cerner Confluence instance, <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://differentvisions.org/homage-to-medieval-langres/">Saint Didier's Flowering Verge...</a></dt>
    <dd>A peer-reviewed article I wrote in collaboration with my research mentor during the 2020 Lockdown. The article was published in the art history journal, <a href="https://differentvisions.org/">Different Visions</a>, which is supported by St. Olaf College (where Kierkegaard's papers are archived) and Oklahoma State University. In this paper, I document an illuminated manuscript held at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The manuscript is analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, using traditional academic methods, as well as digital humanities approaches. I also briefly wax philosophical about the impact of religion, art, and language on the march of history through apocalyptic, world-historical events.

    <dd>A blog post I wrote for UM Kansas City while I was working as an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://daedalus.umkc.edu/CODICES/projects.html">codices digital humanities lab</a>. I describe my experiments with natural language processing. I also discuss how I adapted as a researcher during the pandemic.</dd>
