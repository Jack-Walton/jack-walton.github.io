                    Bandcamp (<a href="https://bandcamp.com/">https://bandcamp.com/</a>) describes itself as "an online record store and music community where passionate fans discover, connect with, and directly support the artists they love." The company claims that 82% of all revenue goes to the artists (<em>About Bandcamp, n.d.</em>). The music service can be directly contrasted with Spotify. The two organizations, however, differ vastly in their information policies. Bandcamp operates on a traditional retail model and collects no information about the users, whereas Spotify operates using a streaming, advertising-based model (<em>Krukowski, 2020</em>). Also, Bandcamp allows you to save your music directly to your hard drive in any of the major audio file formatsâ€”a boon to the discerning audiophile. This paper seeks to accomplish the following goals. First, we provide technical documentation on how to use the Bandcamp retrieval tool. Then, we critique the tool from an Organization of Information (IO) lens. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations to digital information organizations to model the success of Bandcamp.
